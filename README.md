# Oshodi-Air-Quality-Analysis
Using Machine Learning Model to predict the Air-Quality in Oshodi, Lagos Nigeria


#Acknowledgement
The datasets used in this model was retrieved from https://africaopendata.org/dataset/sensorsafrica-airquality-archive-oshodi-lagos

The estimator used to predict the air-quality was Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)

I wasn't able to use the appropiate hyper-parameter to fine tune the model as at now in which i was typing the read.me file and this was due to the less computational power of my PC. As a result of this our model is not able to generalize well on unseen data.
